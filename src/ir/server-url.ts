/**
 * Fill a server URL template with its variables' defaults.
 *
 * Each `{name}` is replaced by `variables[name].default`; a placeholder with no
 * declared variable is kept verbatim and reported in `unresolved`. The same
 * variable may appear more than once, and a declared variable the template
 * never mentions is simply unused. The substituted value is spliced in as text
 * and not scanned again, so a default such as `{other}` cannot trigger a
 * second substitution. A `{` with no closing `}`, an empty `{}`, and a `{`
 * that opens another `{` before closing are all literal text.
 *
 * Plain string scanning only: no pattern is built from the variable names, so
 * a name containing `.`, `+` or any other character is matched as written.
 *
 * The parser uses this for `ApiSpec.baseUrl`; an emitter that offers every
 * server (an environment picker, say) can resolve each `spec.servers[i]` the
 * same way instead of reading the OpenAPI document again.
